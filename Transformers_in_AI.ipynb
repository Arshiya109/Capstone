        "\n",
        "Transformers in deep learning represent a significant advancement in handling sequential data, particularly for tasks such as language translation and text generation. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers process entire sequences simultaneously through a mechanism known as \"self-attention.\" This allows them to dynamically prioritize relevant portions of input data, irrespective of their position within the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "This innovative approach empowers transformers to effectively capture intricate dependencies and relationships across long distances within the sequence. It has sparked a revolution in natural language processing, giving rise to formidable models like BERT and GPT, which excel in comprehending and generating human-like text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's delve into an example program that showcases the utilization of a transformer model for sequence classification using the PyTorch library."

        "\n",
        "The `TextDataset` class is responsible for preparing the dataset by tokenizing texts using the BERT tokenizer and creating data loaders for both the training and validation sets. The model utilizes `BertForSequenceClassification` for classification, the `AdamW` optimizer for parameter optimization, and a learning rate scheduler for adjusting the learning rate during training. The `train_epoch` function handles the training loop, while the `eval_model` function manages the evaluation phase, calculating accuracy and loss metrics. The model saves the best version based on validation accuracy. Additionally, a prediction function (`get_predictions`) is defined to evaluate the model on the validation set. This code is structured to efficiently train and evaluate a BERT-based text classifier, ensuring scalability and performance.\n"

It begins by preparing the dataset through tokenization and creating data loaders for efficient batch processing. The BERT model, specifically BertForSequenceClassification, is employed for its ability to handle sequence-level tasks like text classification. Training is facilitated by the AdamW optimizer and a scheduler, which adjusts the learning rate over epochs.\n",
